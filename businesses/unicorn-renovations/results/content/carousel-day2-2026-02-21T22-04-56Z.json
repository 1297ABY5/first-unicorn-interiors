      "text": "1️⃣ Know what's behind your walls\n\nOld plumbing and hidden electrical runs can add cost and time if discovered mid-project. Ask your contractor to do a proper site assessment before a single tile is touched.\n\nAt Unicorn Renovations, this is included before we quote — no surprises, no excuses."

      "text": "2️⃣ Understand your quote — line by line\n\nA low headline number often hides what's not included: appliance installation, stone fabrication, finishing works.\n\nOur quotes are fixed and fully itemised. Cabinetry, premium stone countertops, integrated appliances — every line is visible before you commit. 98% of our projects are completed within the original quote."

      "text": "3️⃣ Ask who is actually doing the work\n\nMany contractors hand your project to whoever is available. That's how quality slips.\n\nOur entire team is in-house — joiners, fitters, tilers, electricians. Zero subcontractors. Zero strangers in your home. And you'll get daily WhatsApp photo updates so you always know what's happening.\n\n4️⃣ Set a realistic timeline — and protect it\n\nA kitchen renovation typically takes 4–8 weeks depending on scope. Build in a buffer. Agree on milestones in writing. A good contractor will welcome the structure.\n\n5️⃣ Think smarter, not just prettier\n\nIn 2026, the best kitchen upgrades aren't about looks alone — they're about how the space actually works for you. Handcrafted cabinetry built to your layout. Stone surfaces that last a decade. Integrated appliances that free up worktop space. That's a kitchen built for how you live."

The cabinet that finally holds everything. The morning light hitting stone that didn't exist six weeks ago.\n\nIt's not just a renovation. It's the part of your home you use every single day, finally working the way it should. ✨"
