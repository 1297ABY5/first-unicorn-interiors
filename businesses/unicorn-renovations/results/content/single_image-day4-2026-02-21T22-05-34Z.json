Right column labelled 'Unicorn Renovations' with a deep charcoal or navy background, warm gold accent line, and bullet points in white. The Unicorn Renovations logo sits cleanly at the bottom centre. No stock photography — pure typographic brand graphic with subtle glass texture or frosted overlay element in the background to tie to the Glass & Aluminium theme.",

    "story": "When a villa owner in Emirates Hills came to us after a shower enclosure installed by another team started leaking within eight months, we knew exactly what had gone wrong — and exactly how to fix it. Our specialist glass team, led by Rajeev with over a decade of precision fitting experience, doesn't just install glass. They engineer it. Every seal, every bracket, every measurement is done in-house, on-site, by the same hands from start to finish.",
    "detail": "Here's what our Glass & Aluminium Works actually includes that many teams skip: precision-templated measurements before a single panel is cut, anti-corrosion aluminium profiles rated for Dubai's humidity, silicon sealing applied in controlled layers — not rushed in one pass — and a full fit inspection before we hand back your space. No subcontractors. No handoffs. No surprises. From AED 45,000.",
