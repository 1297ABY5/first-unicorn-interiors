And how to avoid every single one."

      "text": "❌ Mistake #1: Skipping waterproofing and paying for it twice\n\nPoor waterproofing is the number one cause of structural damage in Dubai pools. Water migrates into the shell, the deck, and eventually the surrounding structure.\n\n✅ What we do: Anti-leak waterproofing systems are built into every pool renovation as standard — not an optional extra. It's why our work carries a 1-year craftsmanship warranty."

      "text": "❌ Mistake #2: Using subcontractors who disappear mid-project\n\nA pool renovation halted halfway through means a property that can't be listed — and rental income that evaporates by the day.\n\n✅ What we do: Our pool team is 100% in-house. No subcontractors. No handoffs. No delays caused by third parties who don't show up. Your timeline is our timeline."

One team. One timeline. One finish that photographs well and rents faster.\n\n📸 You receive daily WhatsApp photo updates throughout. No chasing. No guessing."
