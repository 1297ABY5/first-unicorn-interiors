This bedroom didn't need knocking down or extending — it needed smarter built-in storage, designed around how the owner actually lives. In 2026, that's the renovation conversation Dubai homeowners are having: not bigger, but better.",
    "detail": "This floor-to-ceiling fitted wardrobe was designed, built in our own workshop, and installed entirely by our in-house team — from first measurement to final soft-close hinge. Bespoke joinery starts from AED 35,000, and you'll receive a 48-hour quote and daily WhatsApp photo updates throughout your project.",
