## Common Objections (all audiences)
1. "Too expensive" → We itemise every material and labour cost. No hidden fees. You see exactly where every dirham goes. Milestone payments so you only pay as work completes.
2. "How long will it take?" → We give exact timelines with daily WhatsApp updates. 98% of our 800+ projects finished within the quoted timeline.
3. "What if something goes wrong?" → 1-year craftsmanship warranty. We fix it free. Plus daily photo updates mean nothing surprises you.
4. "Why should I choose you over competitors?" → 100% in-house team — the people who quote are the people who build. No subcontractors. Female-led with 15+ years UAE experience.
5. "I've been burned before by a contractor" → We hear this constantly. That's exactly why we offer milestone-based payments, daily updates, and fixed pricing. You're in control.
