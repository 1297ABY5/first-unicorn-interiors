### 3-Layer Funnel: Cold → Warm → Hot

**Layer 1: COLD — Awareness (40% of budget)**

- Frequency cap: 2x per week

**Layer 2: WARM — Consideration (35% of budget)**
- Objective: Traffic to primary CTA (from business brand.md)
- Audience: Retarget video viewers (50%+), website visitors (30 days), social engagers (60 days)
- Creative: Social proof, process explainer, pricing/value content

**Layer 3: HOT — Conversion (25% of budget)**
- Objective: Lead form or primary CTA conversion
- Audience: Retarget landing page visitors, CTA clickers, high-intent engagers

## Ad Creative Rules

- Video outperforms static (test both)
- Carousel: 3-5 slides, strong first slide
- Include trust signals from business brand.md in ad copy
- Primary CTA button on all conversion ads
- Never use stock photos — real work or AI-generated only
- Text on image: <20% (Meta policy)

## Ad Copy Structure
