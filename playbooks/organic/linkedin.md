## Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: 2026-02-20

## When to Use
- B2B businesses or B2B angle of any business
- Authority/thought leadership positioning
- Professional networking and lead generation

## Posting Schedule
- **Frequency:** 3-5 posts/week
- **Best times:** Business hours in target market timezone (Tue-Thu highest engagement)
- **Avoid:** Local weekends and public holidays

## Content Mix
- 40% Authority/thought leadership (founder as industry expert)
- 30% Work showcases (B2B angle — ROI, process, timelines)
- 20% Industry insights (market data, trends)
- 10% Personal/team stories (humanise the brand)

## Post Structure
```
[Hook — first line stops the scroll, under 15 words]

[2-3 paragraphs of insight, story, or data — from business voice]

[Soft CTA — never hard sell on LinkedIn]

[3-5 hashtags at bottom, never in body text]
```

## Hook Formats (Universal)
1. "I've spent {years}+ years in {industry}. Here's what most people get wrong about {topic}."
2. "We analysed {number} {things} last {period}. The finding that surprised me most:"
3. "{Bold contrarian statement}. Let me explain."
4. "The difference between {good outcome} and {bad outcome} isn't what you think."
5. "{Number} lessons from {experience}. Thread 🧵"

## Tone Rules
- Professional but personal (first person from founder/leader)
- Data-driven — always include specific numbers
- No hashtags in body — bottom only
- Never salesy — position as educator/expert
- ROI and outcome focused

## Performance Baselines
_Set per-business in targets.md._
