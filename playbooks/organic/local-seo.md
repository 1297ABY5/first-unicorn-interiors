## Review Strategy
- Target: defined in business targets.md reviews_per_month
- Send request via template in conversion playbook, timing from business targets.md
- Positive review response: thank personally, reference specific project details
- Negative review response: acknowledge, take offline, resolve publicly
- NEVER incentivise reviews in ways that violate platform policy

## Directory Listings

- Ensure NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency everywhere
- Update annually or when details change

## Location Pages
- One landing page per: primary service × target location
