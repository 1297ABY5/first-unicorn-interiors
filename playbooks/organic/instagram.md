3. **POV:** "POV: Your {provider_type} actually {positive_action}"
4. **Statistic:** "{percentage}% of {industry} projects go {negative_outcome}. Here's why."
5. **Before/After:** "Swipe to see what {timeline} can do →"
6. **Controversy:** "{Common belief} is overrated. There, I said it. Here's why."

## Carousel Rules (Universal)
- Slide 1: Hook (bold statement or question — NEVER start with company name)

- Slide 6: Reveal/Result (emotional language about the outcome)

- 0-3s: Hook (text overlay — strongest visual or provocative claim)
- 3-8s: Before/context with voiceover
- 8-20s: Transformation/process sequence
- 20-28s: Reveal — slow reveal of finished result
- 28-30s: CTA text overlay + logo from business brand.md
- Voiceover: First person, business voice, under 80 words
- Text overlays: Max 5 words per overlay

## Story Rules (Universal)
- Use polls, sliders, question stickers for engagement
- Behind-the-scenes and process content performs best
- Always include primary CTA link on final story
- Post 3-7 stories per sequence

## Image Guidelines (Universal)
- Real work photos: ALWAYS for results, testimonials, team, proof
- AI-generated: Inspiration, lifestyle, mood boards, aspirational only
