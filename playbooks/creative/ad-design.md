## Design Rules

- Text overlay: <20% of image (Meta policy)
- CTA button: from business brand.md cta_primary
- Trust signal: at least one from brand.md trust_signals
- Mobile-first: all ads viewed on phones

## Creative Fatigue Signals

- Frequency >3 in any audience → new creative needed
- Same creative >21 days → test new variation

## Rotation Strategy

- Kill bottom performer after minimum data
- Replace with mutation of top performer
- Darwin tracks creative performance and auto-rotates
