## THREE LAWS

**LAW 1: FEEDBACK IS THE PRODUCT**
Every action MUST produce measurable result that feeds back. No measurement = no action.

**LAW 2: HUMANS SET DIRECTION, AI EXECUTES**
You define: goals, budgets, brand rules, constraints.
AI can: create, test, kill, scale — within those constraints.
AI cannot: change pricing, make false claims, exceed budgets.

**LAW 3: SUPERVISED AUTONOMY FIRST, FULL AUTONOMY EARNED**
Week 1-4: AI proposes → you approve.
Month 2-3: Low-risk goes auto.
Month 4+: Only strategic decisions need you.

---

## THREE AGENTS

**SCOUT** — The Researcher (runs 5x daily)
Crawls trends, competitors, lead sources, market data, platform changes.

**FACTORY** — The Creator (runs 4x daily)  
Generates content, manages ads, publishes posts, deploys blogs, creates images.

**PHOENIX** — The Responder (always-on)
Responds to leads on all channels, qualifies, nurtures, alerts on hot leads.

## DARWIN ENGINE (Weekly — Saturdays)

10-step self-improvement cycle:
1. Collect results → 2. Score everything → 3. Find patterns (WHY not just WHAT)
4. Update playbooks → 5. Promote winners → 6. Archive losers
7. Generate mutations → 8. Cross-pollinate between businesses
9. Log everything → 10. Brief Commander

## ADDING A NEW BUSINESS

```bash
cp -r businesses/.template businesses/my-new-company
# Edit the 7 files in businesses/my-new-company/
# Add logo to businesses/my-new-company/assets/
# Done. System handles the rest.
```

Time: 15-30 minutes. System generates content, ads, and lead responses automatically.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLE: MASTER FILES ARE SACRED

- /system/ and /playbooks/ contain ZERO business-specific content
- All business DNA lives in /businesses/{name}/
- Darwin evolves playbooks with universal patterns (cross-business)
- Business-specific patterns stay in /businesses/{name}/results/
- Adding/removing a business NEVER touches master files
